# MCP CLIENT
The goal of this MCP client is to help you conect easily a LLM with a server in you local machine.

You can install the dependencies with this command:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I recomend you to use uv, you can see how to use it in the MCP documentation.
```bash
 uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
